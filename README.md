**footnotes** WordPress Plugin

#### this plugin intends to be straight forward and customizable at the same time ####

**footnotes** gives you the ability to display decently-formated footnotes on your WordPress Pages or Posts. **footnotes** aims to be the all-in-one solution that ships with a set of sane defaults (those footnotes we know from offline publishing) but also give the user control over how their **footnotes** are being displayed.

The syntax is based on the common DokuWiki syntax for footnotes. So, to include a footnote with the text "with a footnote," you use:

	Your awesome text((with a footnote))

And that's all you need to do. When you add a footnote, **footnotes** will create a note marker at the point that the foonote appears in the text, and includes the text of the footnote in a styled list of notes down the page. Using `((` + `))` is the default. You can decide on what the shortcode for **footnotes** should be.

This plugin (once released on wordpress.org) will give you full customizability while being shipped with a set of sane defaults.
